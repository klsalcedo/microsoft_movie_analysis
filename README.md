# Microsoft Movie Analysis
#### Group Members: Joanne de Leon and Katarina Salcedo

## Motivation
Provide Microsoft with an understanding of how to create a successful movie studio. We will give insights on how to produce high grossing and top-rated movies thus providing the tools to launch a well known and highly regarded studio.  

## Data 
1. To get information on movie ratings and characteristics we used two Rotten Tomatoes datasets that contained a total of 33517 movie ratings from 20 different genres.
2. For information on movie preformance in theaters, we looked at a dataset from The Numbers which provided information on release dates along with domestic and worldwide gross. This set had 4387 movies ranging from 2000 to 2019. 

## Methodology
1. The Rotten Tomatoes datasets were merged togeter using the ID column to create a new dataset with information on movie ratng and their genres...
2. A subset of The Numbers data containg years ranging from 2000 to 2019 was taken to account for the rate of inflation. This data was then cleaned and release dates were seperated into two columns containing the release month and release year. We were then able to group movie titles into their release months and years then plot this data. From this, we were able to track box office trends. 

## Findings
1. Concentrating on films in the Drama and Comedy genres will ensure viewer turnout as well as introduce the public to the studioâ€™s brand.

2. Significant numbers of viewers watch movies in the Action & Adventure, Mystery & Suspense, Romance, and Science Fiction & Fantasy genres, no matter the rank of rating, implying that the quality of the films in these genres is irrelevant as to whether a viewer will watch. Therefore creating films in these genres will yield a consistent viewership as well as increase exposure of the studio.

3. We narrowed down the months which have consistently brought in the highest box office sales to June, July and November with February and May coming second to these. Microsoft can increase movie profits by aiming to release new movies during these peak months.

4. Based on the yearly trend, we advise Microsoft movie studio to consider streaming their movies in addition to releasing them in theaters to reach a greater audience and ensure success.
